### Loan Decision System Model Analysis Summary

**Overview of Analysis:**
The analysis aimed to evaluate a loan decision system used by a bank to categorize loans as healthy (0) or unhealthy (1), focusing on minimizing false positives and false negatives.

**The Results:**
- *Original Model:* Achieved 100% accuracy for healthy loans (0) and 87% for unhealthy loans (1). Emphasized precision to identify risky loans.
- *Resampled Model Enhancement:* Showed improved precision and recall for both healthy and unhealthy loans, favoring the resampled data model.
- *F1 Score & Accuracy:* Resampled model displayed higher F1 scores and significantly outperformed with an accuracy score of 0.9936.

**Recommendation:**
- **Resampled Data Model:** Strongly recommend implementation due to enhanced prediction of unhealthy loans and balanced approach in evaluating healthy loans.
- **Importance of Predicting "1"s:** Vital for risk mitigation; avoiding bad loans is crucial for financial stability.
- **Balancing Loan Approvals:** Accurate assessment of healthy loans is imperative; denying loans to reliable borrowers impacts business opportunities.

**Summary:**
The resampled data model not only excelled in predicting unhealthy loans but also maintained high accuracy in evaluating healthy loans, making it a reliable choice for the bank's loan decision system.
